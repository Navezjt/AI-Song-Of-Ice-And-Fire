George R. R. Martin's popular series "A Song of Ice and Fire" completed with AI large language models.

*Disclaimer: This is NOT meant to "replace" George R. R. Martin's work. It's an experiment to see how AI writes extensive texts. I respect writers, and am not trying to push the idea that AI can replace them.*

Self-imposed rules:
- No human writing other than the prompts, obviously.
- No paid tools.
- I am not allowed to read any of the books in A Song of Ice and Fire, as I would be able to unnaturally guide the generation.

Tools used:
- ChatGPT: Outline generation and expansion. Writing.
- ChatGPT to Markdown [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-to-markdown/adghjpdmpbcmppeafpodcjpagmegdpci): Exporting chats and feeding them back in for outline expansion.
- Grammarly: Grammar fixes (premium subscription not used).
- Keyboard Maestro: automating the feeding of thousands of prompts into ChatGPT (free trial).

Here's a demo of me using Keyboard Maestro to auto-prompt ChatGPT. The Keyboard Maestro program runs for all 2037 prompts. The program is also capable of using the "continue generating" button when it appears, but it isn't shown in this video.

Outside of this demo the program has an 80 second minimum time between prompts so it doesn't breach the hourly generation limit for ChatGPT.
