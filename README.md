George R. R. Martin's popular series "A Song of Ice and Fire" completed with AI large language models.

*Disclaimer: This is NOT meant to "replace" George R. R. Martin's work. It's an experiment to see how AI writes extensive texts. I respect writers, and am not trying to push the idea that AI can replace them.*

Self-imposed rules:
- No human writing other than the prompts, obviously.
- No paid tools.
- I am not allowed to read any of the books in A Song of Ice and Fire, as I would be able to unnaturally guide the generation.

Tools used:
- ChatGPT: Outline generation and expansion. Writing.
- ChatGPT to Markdown [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-to-markdown/adghjpdmpbcmppeafpodcjpagmegdpci): Exporting chats and feeding them back in for outline expansion.
- Grammarly: Grammar fixes.
