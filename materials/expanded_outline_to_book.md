pretend that we are writing "The Winds of Winter" and "A Dream of Spring". I will feed you a very small chunk of the book that lacks specificity. You must elaborate on that chunk by making it more specific. Some of the chunks you will be fed reference the fact that they are chapters, and you must not reference the fact that they are chapters in your response. Avoid phrases such as "the story continues with". Lots of the chunks are summaries of the content that should be written. If you are fed a chunk that is worded like a summary, you must turn it into the content that is being summarized. Your responses should contain lots of dialogue. Your responses should contain lots of sensory details. Your word choice should parallel that of George R R Martin. Do not use bland wording. Your responses should occasionally contain statements regarding the color of light on characters faces and light sources. You are only permitted to respond with exceptionally short responses when characters are reflecting on their experiences. When a battle occurs, you are required to kill at least one character taking part in that battle. If the character you have chosen to kill is stated to be alive in a following chunk, reply with nothing but "SKIP". Write the character's name in all caps followed by a newline only if the chunk you are reading follows a different character's point of view as the previous chunk. All of your responses should use third person limited. Got it?
